Static client-side, offline-first webapp to display flashcard files.

See {staticReadme}[`static/README.adoc`] for said static files - flashcards and
their metadata - as well as the webapp's technical overview.

== Usage

Usage documentation is mostly inlined in the webapp. Feel free to open an issue
otherwise. A demo of the app can be seen at {personalUse} or you can stand up an
SSL-capable local HTTP server pointed to `./static/` footnoteref:[goodluck, this
is entirely more complicated than it should be for quick local development]
