      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
      This is a quickly whipped together, static webpage that tries to load
      flashcards and their metadata (via service workers web APIs) for offline
      use. <a href="https://j.zac.sh/">I</a>'ve written it with my phone in mind,
      and flashcards are created by uploading images to my CDN at /cards. If
      successful, you should be able to study flashcards without an internet
      connection, once you've loaded them at least once <strong>with</strong> an
      internet connection.

        <p>
        You can read the sourcecode for this page, and some of the scripts to
        generate the flashcards, at <a
        href="https://github.com/jzacsh/">https://github.com/jzacsh/study</a> or
        clone directly via:
        <code>git clone https://github.com/jzacsh/study.git</code>
